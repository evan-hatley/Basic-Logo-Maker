# Basic-Logo-Maker

## Description

  This project was designed to generate an .svg file based on user input. I created this to avoid paying a graphic designer. I created this project as part of the Week 10 Challenge for the KU Front End Coding Bootcamp. The project uses Javascript, node.js, inquirer, and jest to function.

## Installation

  A user will have to download the source code, then install node.js to their computer. After that, add the dependencies of inqurirer and jest, then use the command 'node install' to access them.

## Usage

To use the project, simply open the CLI from the integrated terminal in their IDE, and run 'node index.js'. From there, answer the prompts and the logo will generate. This repo is used to generate basic .svg files based on a shape, color, a 3 letter name, and text color, all based on user input.
